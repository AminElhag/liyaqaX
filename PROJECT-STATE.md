## 3. Technology Stack

### Backend
- Kotlin + Spring Boot 3.x
- PostgreSQL 16, Redis 7
- Gradle (Kotlin DSL only — build.gradle.kts)
- Flyway migrations (currently V5)
- JJWT for JWT, Testcontainers for tests
- ddl-auto: create-drop in dev (no migration needed for dev)

### Frontend (all four web apps)
- React 18, TypeScript strict, Vite
- TanStack Router (file-based) + TanStack Query
- Zustand (UI state only — never server state)
- React Hook Form + Zod
- Tailwind CSS, i18next (Arabic RTL default)
- Vitest + Testing Library

### Mobile
- Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) + Compose Multiplatform (CMP)

### Package manager
- Backend: Gradle
- Frontend: **npm** (NOT pnpm — pnpm caused persistent issues)
- Each frontend app has its own package-lock.json in its own directory
- Root package.json has NO workspaces field

---

## 4. Architecture Decisions (All 14 ADRs)

| # | Title | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| 0001 | Public IDs | UUID v4 for all API-facing IDs; BIGINT PKs internally |
| 0002 | Money | BIGINT halalas — never DECIMAL/FLOAT |
| 0003 | Auth | Stateless JWT — access 15min, refresh 7 days |
| 0004 | Migrations | Flyway versioned SQL files |
| 0005 | Multi-tenancy | Shared schema, organization_id on every table |
| 0006 | Packaging | Feature-based: com.liyaqa.member not com.liyaqa.service |
| 0007 | Errors | RFC 7807 Problem Details JSON |
| 0008 | API | Single Spring Boot backend for all clients |
| 0009 | ZATCA | Server-side only — never frontend |
| 0010 | Mobile | KMP + CMP for Android and iOS |
| 0011 | Versioning | URL path: /api/v1/ |
| 0012 | Deletes | Soft delete via deleted_at nullable timestamp |
| 0013 | Language | Arabic default, English secondary |
| 0014 | RBAC | Fully dynamic per-club roles/permissions, Redis cache |

---

## 5. RBAC System

**Fully dynamic** — no hardcoded role strings in application code.

### How it works
1. User logs in → JWT contains `roleId` (UUID) + `scope` string
2. Every request → backend resolves permissions from Redis cache
3. Cache key: `role_permissions:{roleId}` TTL: 5 minutes
4. If cache miss → fetch from DB → cache result

### JWT shapes

Platform user:
```json
{ "sub": "uuid", "roleId": "uuid", "scope": "platform" }
```

Club staff:
```json
{ "sub": "uuid", "roleId": "uuid", "scope": "club",
  "organizationId": "uuid", "clubId": "uuid", "branchIds": ["uuid"] }
```

Trainer:
```json
{ "sub": "uuid", "roleId": "uuid", "scope": "trainer",
  "trainerTypes": ["pt","gx"], "trainerId": "uuid",
  "organizationId": "uuid", "clubId": "uuid", "branchIds": ["uuid"] }
```

Member:
```json
{ "sub": "uuid", "roleId": "uuid", "scope": "member",
  "memberId": "uuid", "organizationId": "uuid",
  "clubId": "uuid", "branchId": "uuid" }
```

### Key permission codes
```
organization:create/read/update/delete
club:create/read/update/delete
branch:create/read/update/delete
staff:create/read/update/delete
member:create/read/update/delete
membership:create/read/update/freeze/unfreeze
payment:collect/read/refund
invoice:read/generate
pt-package:create/read
pt-session:create/read/update/mark-attendance
gx-class:create/read/update/manage-bookings/mark-attendance
lead:create/read/update/convert
report:revenue:view/retention:view/utilization:view
role:create/read/update/delete
system:impersonate
audit:read
```

### Default seeded roles
Platform: Super Admin, Support Agent, Integration Specialist, Read-Only Auditor
Club: Owner, Branch Manager, Receptionist, Sales Agent, PT Trainer, GX Instructor
Member: Member

All seeded roles have `isSystem = true` — cannot be deleted via UI.

## 8. Known Critical Issues (Warn Claude Code About These)

### JPQL query bug (recurring — 4 times so far)
**Symptom:** ALL integration tests fail at Spring context startup
with `QueryCreationException` → `SemanticException`.
**Cause:** A `@Query` annotation uses JPQL syntax for date/time
operations that Hibernate rejects.
**Rule:** For ANY query involving dates, intervals, functions like
YEAR(), EXTRACT(), or type arithmetic → ALWAYS use `nativeQuery = true`
with SQL table/column names (snake_case).
**Also:** Native queries with Pageable require a separate `countQuery`.
**Files fixed so far:** PTSessionRepository, GXClassInstanceRepository,
MembershipRepository, InvoiceRepository.

### Test passwords (security)
Test files must use constants, never inline strings:
`const val TEST_PASSWORD = "Test@12345678"`
Never: `"password123"`, `"Pass1234!"`, `"correctpass"` etc.

### npm lockfile location
Each frontend app needs its own package-lock.json.
Run `npm install` from INSIDE the app directory.
Root package.json must NOT have a `workspaces` field.

- `MemberLapsePulseController`: 3 endpoints (GET lapsed list, POST renewal-offer, POST bulk renewal-offer)
- Renewal offer deduplication: skip if FOLLOW_UP note with "Renewal offer sent" exists in last 24h
- web-pulse: /memberships/lapsed page with table, per-row offer, bulk action, sidebar badge with count
- web-pulse: Lapsed badge on members list (red, same as terminated)
- web-arena: full-screen non-dismissable LapsedBanner when memberStatus === 'lapsed', all nav hidden
- 16 new backend tests (8 unit + 8 integration), 2 new frontend tests (web-pulse), 2 new frontend tests (web-arena)
- 594 backend tests total, 149 frontend tests (web-pulse), 2 frontend tests (web-arena)

### Next — Remaining roadmap
```
mobile-arena — KMP/CMP mobile app (Android + iOS) — not started (parked)
Plan 17 — ZATCA Phase 2 (Fatoora API) — blocked (needs ZATCA certificates per club)
Plan 22 — Member self-registration — allow members to register without staff
```

### Mobile
```
Plan 21 — mobile-arena (KMP/CMP) — native iOS + Android member app
```

## 10. ZATCA Phase 1 — COMPLETE

**Shipped:** Phase 1 (generation only — no Fatoora API submission).
**Phase 2** (Fatoora API, UBL XML, SDK signing) is a separate future plan.

### What was built
- `ZatcaTlvEncoder` — pure Kotlin TLV encoding, tags 0x01–0x05
- `ZatcaHashUtil` — SHA-256 canonical string hash + INITIAL_PIH constant
- `ZatcaQrService` — orchestrates QR generation per invoice
- `InvoiceCounter` entity — per-club atomic sequential counter (cannot reset)
- `createInvoice` — full 11-step ZATCA flow replaces old stub
- PIH chain: each invoice stores hash of previous; first invoice uses INITIAL_PIH
- Club.vatNumber added; fallback: club → org → "PENDING-VAT-REGISTRATION"

### Invoice entity ZATCA fields (all populated on creation)
```kotlin
var zatcaStatus: String = "generated"
var zatcaUuid: String?               // = invoice.publicId.toString()
var zatcaHash: String?               // SHA-256 of canonical string
var zatcaQrCode: String?             // base64 TLV, tags 0x01–0x05
var previousInvoiceHash: String?     // PIH chain
var invoiceCounterValue: Long?       // sequential per club
```

### TLV QR code fields (Phase 1, in order)
```
Tag 0x01: Seller name (organization.nameAr, UTF-8)
Tag 0x02: VAT registration number (club.vatNumber ?: org.vatNumber)
Tag 0x03: Invoice timestamp (issuedAt, ISO 8601 UTC with Z)
Tag 0x04: Invoice total with VAT (SAR decimal string, 2dp)
Tag 0x05: VAT amount (SAR decimal string, 2dp)
```
Tags 0x06–0x09 are Phase 2 only (ECDSA signature, public key, CA stamp).

### Phase 2 data foundation (ready)
All fields needed by Phase 2 SDK are already stored:
invoice_counter_value, previous_invoice_hash, zatca_uuid, zatca_hash, zatca_qr_code.
When Phase 2 ships, SDK replaces zatca_hash and zatca_qr_code with signed versions.

## 11. How Plans Are Written

Every PLAN.md Claude writes for this project must follow this structure:

```markdown
# PLAN.md — [Feature Name]

## Status
Ready for implementation

## Branch

## Goal
[What this plan builds and why — 2-3 sentences]

## Context
[What already exists that this plan extends]

## Scope — what this plan covers
- [ ] Backend item 1
- [ ] Frontend item 1

## Out of scope — do not implement in this plan
- item A
- item B

## Decisions already made
- Decision 1 (with reasoning if non-obvious)

## Entity design
[New JPA entities with all field definitions]

## API endpoints
[HTTP method + path for every new endpoint]

## Request / Response shapes
[JSON examples for key DTOs]

## Business rules — enforce in service layer
1. Rule one — what to check, what to return on violation
2. Rule two

## Seed data updates
[What gets added/changed in DevDataLoader]

## Frontend additions
[Screens, components, API functions if applicable]

## Files to generate
### New files
[list]
### Files to modify
[list]

## Implementation order
Step 1 — [name]
  [specific files and what to implement]
  Verify: [exact command]

Step 2 — ...

## Acceptance criteria
### Backend
- [ ] criterion

### Frontend (if applicable)
- [ ] criterion

## RBAC matrix rows added by this plan
[table with permission codes as rows]

## Definition of done
- All acceptance criteria checked
- All tests pass (backend: ./gradlew test, frontend: npm test)
- ktlintCheck passes
- PLAN.md deleted before merging
